# hello-world
My name is Aleks. I live in Southern Germany and i work as a quality engineer. My company, where I am employed, is not working well -crisis- Therefore I want to make my hobby to my profession and maintain websites or experiment with other programming languages.  
My goal is to learn some programming languages. First I will learn HTML and CSS. Then Java and Python, further I do not want to plan. Of course I will learn and work through the Git-Hub course first.
In this sense I wish all Git-Hub members  happy programming.
